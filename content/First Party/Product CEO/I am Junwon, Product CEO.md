## Nice to meet you. I am Junwon Park 

During the day, I manage visual search products at Microsoft AI & Research, in Bellevue, Washington. During the weekends, I hike the Cascade mountains with my books and journal, and enjoy life while reading and writing in nature. During the evening, I am here, to talk to you and to listen to your stories, and to grow with you as product managers and business leaders.  

## Pioneering the possibilities of artificial intelligence 

I am in my third year researching with Professor Fei-Fei Li at Stanford AI Lab and Professor Michael Bernstein at Stanford HCI Group, publishing papers and presenting posters at conferences like ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing, and ECCV European Conference on Computer Vision. My research focus is on improving the development process of AI systems by building novel tools such as an AI agent that engages with social media users to gather image annotations for supervised learning, and an image transformation system to evaluate computer vision models on generalizability, robustness, and extensibility, before they are deployed in the real world.   

## Productizing technologies to solve customer needs 

Before my current position at Microsoft, I founded and led a financial technology startup in Y Combinator Startup School and Stanford Cardinal Ventures. Taking to the market the Best Project Award winner from Stanfordâ€™s iOS Application Programming class, Orbis offered a platform for any Robinhood users to subscribe to, and share profits with the developers of, investing algorithms. As a builder at heart, I commit myself to turning great ideas into actionable experiments and real existing products. This rapid fire process led me to develop a speaker recognizing virtual assistant, a museum journal which tracks the time spent admiring each art piece, and a computer vision model which modifies images by adding or removing objects described in word by the user, which won the Best Project Awards respectively at the Virtual Assistants class by Professor Monica Lam, the Human Computer Interaction class by Professor James Landay, and the Machine Learning class by Professor Andrew Ng, at Stanford University. Now, I focus on addressing enterprise needs, and I publish my projects, free and open source, on this website for the builders in the technology industry. 

## Aligning people under common goals 

A leader is responsible connecting people with the same goals and helping them work better together. With this belief, I founded Stanford AI Group with Professor Andrew Ng and led it as its first president to bring together passionate engineers into technical projects and concerned debaters into ethical discussions. As the president of Stanford Marketing Group, I also directed an organization that matched businesses in need of help and students in need of experience, providing an opportunity for the students to learn and practice marketing at Stanford where marketing is not offered as a major to the undergraduates. As an elected undergraduate representative at the student government at Stanford University, I introduced technology platforms for receiving and prioritizing student demands and for archiving meeting records for community access, enabling the administrators to create a safer and a more transparent campus that students needed and administrators wanted to provide. In these different organizations, my focus has always been the same: aligning people under common goals, organizing the interests of stakeholders to equate what is best for one with what is best for all. 

## And here for you as Product CEO 

Management, the art of building and operating large organizations to achieve what the humankind considered impossible, captivates me as the most intellectually stimulating study and the most impactful contribution to the society. Through Product CEO, I seek to empower and be empowered by other builders and leaders in the technology industry so that we can achieve more together. If you are working on something great, tell me your story, the customer needs you are addressing, and the obstacles you are running into. I look forward to our conversations and the world we will create through the products we ship.
