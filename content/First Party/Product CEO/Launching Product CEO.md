## A website about product management
An enterprise exists to ship great products that enrich the lives of people, thereby strengthening the humankind. Recruiting and training talents, designing and developing solutions to real problems, describing clearly and delivering efficiently the products to the customers, capturing profit to fund building and shipping of the next generation of products; an enterprise carries out each of these activities for one goal: to ship great products. Our legacy will be measured by the impact we have on our stakeholders through the products we ship. Through Product CEO, I seek to empower you to ship better products to more people at a faster speed, by delivering to you relevant contents and useful tools.

## For the builders in the technology industry
I know for whom I am writing and for whom I am not. I am not writing for general consumers or technical scientists. This focus enables me to write articles that are concise and useful to you, cutting to the bone, in each content, so that you can walk away quickly with what you need. I summarize papers from AI conferences, not on how it works, but on when you need it and how you can use it. I share Excel spreadsheets and Python notebooks that implement the theoretical formulas I describe so that you can download them, enter your numbers, and immediately get back a demand forecast for your business. I will save you time so that you can spend it building better products and a better world.

## With contents ranging from management theories to enterprise tools
As a PM at Microsoft and an AI researcher from Stanford, I encounter interesting problems and solutions in design, engineering, marketing, and everything in between. This website is a portal for me to share with you all the learnings I am gaining and the tools I am building or using, so that you can leverage on my work, so that we can go farther together.

## Letâ€™s chat! Connect with me on social media.
I want to hear your stories, the customer needs you are addressing, and the obstacles you are running into. If your mission to ship great products is being hindered by a big pain that others in the industry are also suffering from, let me know. I will build for you tools specifically catered to your problem, and unblock you to march on. No need to click like or subscribe. Just shoot me a message on Facebook, Twitter, or email me at junwon@product.ceo. I look forward to our conversations.
