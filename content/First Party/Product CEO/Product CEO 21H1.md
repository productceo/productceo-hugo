## Post Mortem 

In 2020, Product CEO successfully launched Library of Business, Executive Summary, and First Party. A sufficient amount of content was accumulated for distribution. However, Product CEO needs improvements on three fronts in order to better realize its business impact. 

**Design**: Product CEO 2020 is designed to make visitors focus on reading. Product CEO 21H1 must be designed to make visitors share content and follow me. 

**Distribution**: Product CEO 2020 pursued ineffective channels on which even I do not seek or consume business content (e.g. Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest). Product CEO 21H1 should shut down the ineffective channels and focus on the effective ones.  

**Integration**: Product CEO 2020 did not leverage my assets. Product CEO 21H1 will leverage my credentials as Microsoft PM and Stanford CS as well as my money for advertisements. 

## Objectives 

Following are not objectives of Product CEO 21H1: building a community, demonstrating leadership in cutting edge technology research, generating monetary profit.  

The objective of Product CEO is to maximize reputation. The target audience are PMs, EMs, managers, executives, and entrepreneurs in the technology industry. I will measure its success with following metrics: **Number of followers across LinkedIn and Twitter**.  

This is the user story. User is a manager at a technology company. User is browsing for materials to read. If the user is on a social media platform where the user can follow Product CEO, content is delivered on the platform itself. If user is on a platform where user cannot follow Product CEO, link is provided to access the article on www.product.ceo. User first sees Product CEO credibility, then reads the article, then is called to action: share the content, follow Product CEO.
