I am excited to announce on behalf of my team at Microsoft that we not only set a new state-of-the-art in general pretrained vision models, we are also publicly releasing this model for the research community and the industry. We are accelerating deep learning research and computer vision production by empowering every person and every organization on the planet to use our model, for free, for research and for commercial purposes.

Since I joined Microsoft, I have shipped several features that touch millions of users, but this marks the first product I get to announce with my name attached! Zygmunt and I worked hard for this release, and we are excited to see what the researchers and developers will achieve with our SOTA vision model. 

I feel lucky to work under the leadership of Ravi Yada, Mark Bolin, Kun Wu, Meenaz Merchant, Arun Sacheti, and Jordi Ribas, who equip us to produce industry-leading work and encourage us to amplify our impact. In this team, I will continue to ship world class computer vision models to enhance our product and push the industry to build better AI.
