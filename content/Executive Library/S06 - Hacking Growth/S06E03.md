While creating a must-have product alone is not sufficient to achieve a breakout success, it is the baseline requirement for rapid and sustainable growth. You must not move into a high tempo growth experimentation until you know your product is must-have, why it’s must-have, and to whom it is must-have. In other words, you must understand what the core value proposition and the core customers of your product. Probe into user behavior to discover the core value of their product or service. Users often find value in ways not intended by the developers. For example, the intended core value of YouTube was dating, but the users found video sharing to be more compelling.  

BranchOut launched a massive marketing campaign before they found a true product market fit. When users tried the app, they found it disappointing. The tidal wave of new users turned into a rapid deluge of users leaving. ERE Media even called the marketing, “a digital Ponzi scheme”. After shutting the app down, the founder conceded that the company had erred in trying to rush user acquisition without delivering on the product experience first. To warn themselves against such mistakes, growth team at Airbnb says, “love creates growth, not the other way around.” 

Find the aha moment. That is the product market fit. Product market fit is the moment that the utility of the product really clicks for the users, when the users really get the core value: what the product is for, why they need it, and what benefit they derive from using it. Twitter team found that users who quickly started following at least 30 other users were much more engaged and likely to continue using the service. For Slack, it was when team members had sent and received 2,000 messages to one another.  

### The must-have survey 
You can use the must-have survey to evaluate whether users consider your product must-have. 
1. How disappointed would you be if this product no longer existed tomorrow? 
   1. Very disappointed; Somewhat disappointed; Not disappointed. 
   2. Aim for at least 40% “very disappointed”. 
2. What would you likely use as an alternative if this product was  no longer available? 
3. What is the primary benefit that you have received from this product? 
4. Have you recommended this product to anyone? 
5. What type of person do you think would benefit most from this product? 
6. How can we improve this product to better meet your needs? 

### Measuring retention

A visible outcome of a must-have product is user retention. Top 10 apps retain 60% of users after 1 month, 50% after 3 months.  

To understand why users leave, Twitter asked users who went dormant, then subsequently returned: 
1. Can you tell us why you signed up in the first place? 
2. What didn’t work for you? Why did you leave? 
3. What caused you to come back and try it again? 
4. What worked this time? 

### Efficient experimentation 
Run minimum viable tests (MVTs), the least costly experiments that can be run to adequately vet an idea. If an MVT is successful, the team can invest in a more robust follow-on test or more polished implementation of the concept.  

One particularly powerful and typically inexpensive method is A/B testing, by which two different messages or two different designs are tested on two or more randomly targeted groups of people to determine which elicits the more desired response.  

During their search for product market fit, product developers must be keenly aware of the danger of feature creep: adding more and more features that do not truly create core value and that often make products cumbersome and confusing to use. 

Event tracking is the process of understanding what users are doing on the product by monitoring key events within your system such as when a user clicks a button. Analysts should be looking for features that are most used by the most avid users and any other distinctive aspects of their behavior in interacting with the product.  

Instagram started as Burbn, a location-based social network. He found that users weren’t using many of product features except the photo sharing feature. Systrom and Krieger realized that taking and sharing photos were the aha experience, then they chopped everything out of Burbn except the photo, comment, and like features in order to refine the product down to that essence. Pinterest began as Tote, a mobile commerce app, but pivoted to relaunch as a discovery and sharing website when Silbermann saw users weren’t making purchases, but instead stockpiling massive collections of things they coveted on the app.  

Data analysis can also confirm that it’s not about the product, but about messaging or introduction. HubSpot changed its sales policy to make paid product training a mandatory part of the new customer experience.  

### Identifying Your Growth Levers 
Andy Johns, former growth lead at Facebook, Twitter, Wealthfront, and Quora, urges companies to craft fundamental growth equation. Doing so will help the companies analyze their core set of growth levers. Growth teams should prioritize experimenting with key levers to find the dimension of highest impact, and deprioritize fine tuning parameters in low impact dimensions.  

These are three example fundamental growth equations by Andy Johns: 

1. Inman News: (Website Traffic * Email Conversation Rate * Active User Rate * Conversion to Paid Subscriber) + Retained Subscribers + Resurrected Subscribers = Subscriber Revenue Growth. 
2. eBay: Number of Sellers Listing Items * Number of Listed Items * Number of Buyers * Number of Successful Transactions = Gross Merchandise Volume Growth. 
3. Amazon: Vertical Expansion * Product Inventory per Vertical * Traffic per Product Page * Conversion to Purchase * Average Purchase Value * Repeat Purchase Behavior = Revenue Growth.  

Each variable must be tweakable. The goal is to understand which ones we can change and which ones we should prioritize.  

The North Star metric is the metric that most accurately captures the core value the product creates for customers. For eBay, it is the gross merchandise volume; For WhatsApp, number of messages sent; For Airbnb, nights booked. Correctly understanding which metrics to optimize for is the first step to building a product that is great for the business. 

Finally, the data should be presented in an interpretable manner. Massive spreadsheets of user data, database queries, and highly technical displays are not useful for gaining insights into user behaviors or sharing learnings with stakeholders. Make intuitive dashboards, not only to reduce cognitive strain, but to actually understand the data accurately.
