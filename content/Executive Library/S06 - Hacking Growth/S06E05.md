## Language Market Fit and Channel Product Fit 
The first stage of customer funnel is acquisition. Whereas “product market fit” is “being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market,” authors of Hacking Growth argue that obtaining product market fit is not enough to build a successful business. On top of product market fit, the company also needs language market fit and channel product fit to achieve explosive growth. Language market fit is achieved when the company’s description of the product resonates with the target audience. Channel product fit is achieved when the marketing channels that the company has selected to reach the intended audience is cost-effective and far-reaching. 

The average human attention span is eight seconds. That is why the marketing language must directly and persuasively connect with a need or a desire to hook the users in eight seconds or less. As an example, the original iPod was marketed with a captivating phrase, “1,000 songs in your pocket.” As an executive at a home improvement chain once told me, “sell the hole, not the drill.” Marketing should describe, not the product you want to sell, but the value you want to deliver. 

## LMF and CPF in Practice: Tickle and Febreeze 
Febreeze was an engineering feat when it was first invented. Unlike the competing products that just covered odors with a stronger smell, Febreeze disintegrated the source of odor, thereby fundamentally removing the bad smell. P&G also presented it with a precise description, “Febreeze cleans bad smells out of fabrics for good.” Yet, the product did not take off. This is an example of a product market fit, as the Febreeze was a great product that solved a big market need, that did not lead to business success due to the lack of language market fit. P&G’s growth team discovered that customers actually did not care about removing bad smell as much as they cared about adding good scent. The product became a phenomenon after P&G added scent back into the product and repositioned it with a resonating language, “for freshness that surrounds you like never before.” 

Tickle, on the other hand, is a case of purposefully using marketing language designed to fuel viral growth. Tickle’s growth team added a whopping 53 million users to the photo sharing service in mere 6 months. Their secret trick? They changed the marketing phrase on the landing page from “store your photos online” to “share your photos online.” Notice that the marketing phrase influences not only whether the user will choose to use the service or not, but also how the users will use the product once they do choose to use the product. Reproducing their own success, Tickle’s growth team added another 29 million users to the company’s dating service in mere 8 months by changing the marketing phrase on the landing page from “find a date” to “help people find a date,” once again using language to fuel viral growth. 

## Experimenting to achieve language market fit

Component variation is A/B testing for the marketing phrase. Pinterest used component variation in a practice they named copytune optimization to maximize the effectiveness of a notification message, A/B testing the possible variations of each component in the notification message.  

## Finding the right channel for marketing and distribution 
Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and Palantir, tells startup founders, “it is very likely that one channel is optimal. Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. Poor distribution, not product, is the number one cause of failure. If you can get even a single distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several, but don’t nail one, you’re finished.” Instead of spreading resources across a wide variety of channels, the company must experiment quickly to find the effective channels, then invest heavily in the most effective channels. 

Finding an effective marketing channel is done in two stages. In the discovery stage, the growth team experiments with a range of options. In the optimization stage, the team maximizes both the cost-effectiveness and the reach of channels as the company keeps scaling up.  

### Examples of marketing channels 
Authors of Hacking Growth classify marketing channels into three categories: viral channels, organic channels, and paid channels. Examples of each are the following: 

* Viral channels: social media, embeddable widgets, friend referral programs, online video, community engagement, contests and giveaways, platform integrations, crowdfunding, games and quizzes 
* Organic channels: search engine optimization, public relations and speaking, content marketing, app store optimization, free tools, email marketing, community building, strategic partnerships, contributed articles, website merchandising 
* Paid channels: offline ads, online ads, affiliate advertising, influencer campaigns, radio, retargeting, ad networks, sponsorships, native content ads 

For content marketing, following are the channels to consider: case studies, how-to guides, press releases, infographics, special reports, articles, PDFs and eBooks, web forums, reviews, videos, PowerPoint presentations, images and photos, interviews, lists, Q&A websites, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, LinkedIn Pulse, Twitter, local business listings, Podcasts, Ask Me Anything series, quizzes, free tools, Medium posts, Buzzfeed, testimonials. 

## Experimenting to achieve channel product fit 
Brian Balfour, Vice President of Growth at HubSpot, suggests ranking marketing channels to experiment based on a set of six factors:  
1. Cost: How much you expect to have to spend to run the experiment in question, 
2. Targeting: How easy it is to reach your intended audience and how specific you can set the target audience, 
3. Control: How much control you have over the experiment. Can you make changes to the experiment once it’s live? Can you stop it easily or adjust if it’s not going well? 
4. Input time: How much time it will take the team to launch the experiment. Filming a television ad for example has a much longer input time than setting up a Facebook ad, 
5. Output time: How long it will take to get results out of the experiment once it’s live. For example, search engine optimization experiments or social media may have longer output times than a radio ad does, 
6. Scale: How large an audience you can reach with the experiment. Television has a much larger scale than does advertising on topical blogs.
