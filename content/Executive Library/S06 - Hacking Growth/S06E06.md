## Customer activation 
An acquired customer, who has tried the product, may not yet fully realize the benefits of the product. Motivating them to realize the full benefits of the product, thereby increasing their engagement, is customer activation. 

One way to understand the effectiveness of your customer activation is using activation surveys. Activation surveys should be brief and delivered under two main conditions: 1) when user activity indicates confusion, such as lingering on one page for too long or leaving the screen or page on the app or site; or 2) right after user has gone ahead and taken the step that many others aren’t taking, such as creating an account or making a purchase. These surveys should be one or two questions maximum. 

## Designing for conversion 
In user experience design, friction is any annoying hindrances that prevent the users from accomplishing the action they’re trying to complete.  

Desire - Friction = Conversation Rate. First landing page of NUX (new user experience) must accomplish three fundamental things: communicate relevance, show the value of the product, and provide a clear call to action. 

## Clever strategies to increase activation 
Flip the funnel. Allow visitors to start experiencing the joys of your product before asking them to sign up. Customers are more likely to endure the sign up process or pay for the product when they have a clear understanding of the value the product offers to them. 

An extension of that strategy is collecting stored value. Stored value is the value that a product has to a user, because of the information they have put into the product. This may be their preferences for recommendation systems or their payment information for a quick checkout. The more information people put into a product, the more their commitment increases. 

## Designing the learn flow 
Learn flow is a term coined by Josh Elman, the former Head of Growth at Twitter, to describe a new user experience that is designed to educate new users about the product, its benefits and value, and how to use it in the process. It’s like a game tutorial. 

Gamification can be an effective strategy for designing learn flows. Adobe saw a 4x increase in trial to purchase conversion after adding missions and levels that could only be unlocked by completing educational tasks. However, gamification can also backfire. Zappos launched a VIP program offering badges to loyal customers, but the badges offered no value, no higher discounts, or any other benefits. This left customers confused, and Zappos ultimately scraped the VIP program.  

## Triggers to form habits 
BJ Fogg is a psychology researcher at Stanford. He developed the Fogg behavior model, which describes that Behavior = motivation x ability x prompts (a.k.a. triggers).

Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit Forming Products, compares customer activation to receiving a phone call. Whether you answer a call is dependent on 1) whether the phone is handy and 2) you have the freedom and ability to take it, as well as other motivating factors such as whether you know the name of the caller, wish to talk to them, or perhaps need some information that they possess. 

BJ Fogg divides triggers into three types:  
1. a spark is for high ability and low motivation to encourage first action,  
2. a facilitator trigger is for users with high motivation but low ability, 
3. a signal trigger is for users with high motivation and high ability to encourage repeat action. 

Robert Cialdini in his book Influence offers six more triggers, which he calls “principles of persuasion”: 
1. Reciprocity: People are more likely to do something in return of a favor, regardless of the favor done and the ask now presented to them. 
2. Commitment and consistency: People who have taken one action are likely to take another, regardless of the size or difference in action. 
3. Social proof: In a state of uncertainty, people look to the actions of others to help them make their own decisions. 
4. Authority: People look to those in the position of authority to decide which actions to take. 
5. Liking: People will do business more readily with people and companies they like over those they don’t like or are indifferent to. 
6. Scarcity: People will take action when they are worried that they will miss out on the opportunity in the future.
