## Failure of great companies
The Innovator’s Dilemma is a book about the failure of companies. Not just of simply any company, but of great companies. The kind that many managers have admired and tried to emulate. 
There is a common misconception that big successful companies fail because they become too slow. People believe big successful companies make decisions too slowly, or they neglect research and development of new technologies, or they become out of touch with what their customers actually need. 
When Clayton Christensen investigated these hypotheses, he discovered that big successful companies were actually managed very well. They invested aggressively in market research and new technologies, listened carefully to their customers, and successfully delivered high margin products that their customers wanted. 
However, Christensen also discovered that there are times in which it is right not to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower performance products that promise lower margins, and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets. That is the innovator’s dilemma. The very best practices that make a big organization successful are the very practices that disables it from making right decisions in critical moments. 

## Sustaining Technologies vs Disruptive Technologies

Sustaining technologies improve established products along the dimensions of performance that the customers have historically valued. Disruptive technologies are innovations that result in worse product in near term, but have features that few fringe customers value. 
Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient to use. They promise lower profit margins or initially appeal only to the least profitable customers in the market. Therefore, big successful companies with a practiced discipline of listening to their best customers and identifying most profitable opportunities fail to justify investing in disruptive technologies until it is too late.  

## The principles of disruptive innovation
Clayton Christensen proposes that there are five principles of disruptive innovation. 
### Principle 1: Companies depend on customers and investors for resources. 
The theory of resource dependence states that while managers may think they control the flow of resources, in the end it is really customers and investors who dictate how money will be spent. Big successful companies have well-developed systems for killing ideas that their customers don’t want. As a result, they fail to invest adequate resources in disruptive technologies which low margin opportunities that their customers don’t want.  
### Principle 2: Small markets don’t solve the growth needs of large companies. 
Large companies adopt a strategy of waiting until new markets are large enough to be interesting. 
### Principle 3: Markets that don’t exist can’t be analyzed. 
Managers at big successful companies demand market data when none exists and make judgements upon financial projections when neither revenues or costs can be known. The peril of data-driven decisions is that data is by definition from the past. 
### Principle 4: An organization’s capabilities define its disabilities. 
An organization’s capabilities reside in two places: its processes and its values. The very processes and values that define an organization’s capabilities in one context defines its disabilities in another context. 
### Principle 5: Technology supply may not equal market demand. 
Suppliers often overshoot their markets. To increase price and thus profit margin, they give customers more than they need or are ultimately willing to pay for. Customers choose, not to achieve more at the same price, but to achieve same at a lower price.
