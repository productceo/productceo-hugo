Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner wrote the book What’s Your Digital Business Model for old corporations who have built their business operations on analog infrastructure and now face the need to transform their fundamental business model to compete against companies built for the digital age.  

## The Digital Threat 
Digital threat exists in an industry if the industry can be characterized as the following: 
1. The products can be searched digitally. 
2. The products can be delivered digitally. 
3. The products can be augmented with digital information. 

To fight against the digital threats, the executives must be clearly aware of the following: 
1. The identity of most important end customers 
2. Their purchase history with your enterprise 
3. Their purchase history with your competitors 
4. Their purchase history of all products your enterprise sells 
5. Their interaction history with your enterprise 
6. Their business (B2B) or personal (B2C) goals 
7. Their purchase decision making process 

## The Digital Business Model 
A company’s business model is either in the form of a value chain or an ecosystem. 
1. A value chain is organized around a dominant enterprise’s products and services.  
2. An ecosystem is organized around a network of partners, suppliers, complementors, and customers. 

The strongest digital companies today have ecosystem business models which is highly scalable and highly versatile. Enterprises can digitally innovate their business models in two ways: 
1. By better understanding and delivering what their end customers want, 
2. By operating in an increasingly coordinated network of enterprises, devices, and customers to create value for all participants.

Weill and Woerner propose the Digital Business Model Framework Quadrant to segment companies into four categories, and encourage them to move toward being Ecosystem Drivers. 
1. Suppliers have a partial knowledge of their end customers and operate in value chain of another. Example suppliers are insurance companies that sell through independent agents, electronic product manufacturers that sell through retailers, and mutual funds that sell through brokers. Suppliers are pressured to reduce prices.  
2. Omnichannels provide access to their products across multiple channels. Example omnichannels includes Nordstrom, Walmart, and Citibank. They own the customer relationship and customer understanding.  
3. Modular producers provide plug-and-play products or services that adapt to any number of ecosystems. Modular producers operate in hypercompetitive markets. Examples of modular producers are API companies like PayPal. They only see partial customer data, and are easily replaced by competitors. 
4. Ecosystem drivers foster relationships with providers of complementary services to more completely meet the needs of customers. Examples of ecosystem drivers are technology companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Tencent (WeChat).  

## Reinventing a Business for the Digital Age 
Reinventing your business for the digital age requires two fundamental capabilities: capabilities for increasing customer understanding and capabilities for increasing ecosystem control. 

Capabilities for increasing customer understanding include the following: 
1. Gathering and using great information about customers’ life events. 
2. Amplifying customer voice inside the enterprise. 
3. Creating a culture of evidence-based decision making. 
4. Providing an integrated, multiproduct, multichannel customer experience. 

Capabilities for increasing ecosystem control include the following: 
1. Being the distinctive first place your best customers go to when a need arises.  
2. Identifying and developing great partnerships and acquisitions. 
3. Exposing APIs to increase channel of distribution for your best products and services. 
4. Developing efficiency, security, and compliance as competencies.  

A company’s commitment to digital transformation is heavily influenced by the following factors: 
1. Threat: Disruption by innovative digital technologies are impending or already present. 
2. Vision: Executives are actively discussing and endorsing new technologies.  
3. New Capabilities: Organization has sufficient resources such as the leadership, investment, governance, and sharing. 
4. Organizational Readiness: The organization has already experimented with the new technology internally.  

## Digital Transformation Leadership 
For the digital transformation to be successful, the leadership should exhibit the following three characteristics in their operation: 
1. The leadership should act top down first. They should indicate the desired pace of change and clarify indicators of success. The leadership team should bring the organization together under shared goals and measures of success.  
2. The leadership should communicate transformation internally and externally, and create an expectation that organization needs to act differently. 
3. The leadership should drive and reinforce the cultural change. 

The board is in charge of three digitization activities: defense, oversight, and strategy. 
1. Defense is preventing cyber risks, data privacy breaches, service interruptions, compliance issues. 
2. Oversight is overseeing implementation of large mission-critical systems, and reviewing spending levels on digitization across enterprise.  
3. Strategy is contributing to and evaluating the digitization strategy. An effective mechanism for working on strategy is going on retreats where external speakers and internal leaders present their ideas briefly, then the participants discuss extensively. Another effective mechanism is internal and external case studies.  

## Digital Competitive Advantage 
Digitization empowers customers to interact with the company whenever and wherever they choose, and enhances the company’s understanding of its customers. In the digital competition, a player can obtain advantage from one of three sources: 
1. Content: Products and information. 
2. Customer Experience: Quality of interaction, ease of use, synergy across multiple products. 
3. Platforms: Processes and infrastructure through which content is delivered. 

The player can also outcompete the competitors by preparing for the mobile technology and internet of things using the following five strategies: 
1. Broad enhancement: Increase customer engagement by providing a useful, typically free, service that enhances the brand. 
2. Multichannel: Improve the customer experience by integrating across channels. 
3. B2B2C: Connect to end customers directly for enterprises that typically sell to end customers via another enterprise.  
4. Targeted Segment: Create a unique offering for an important segment. 
5. Mobile first: Launch all innovations on the mobile channel.
